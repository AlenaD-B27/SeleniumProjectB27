- ACTIONS:

- Why do we need Actions class?
 - To handle "advanced" mouse and keyboard actions

Such as: - moveToElement()
         - clickAndHold()
         - dragAndDrop()
         - contextClick() --> right click
         - doubleClick()
         - pause()
         - perform() --> you have to use this method at the end of actions method
         - keyDown(): imitates as if user presses a key from keyboard and holds it down
         - keyUp(): imitates as if user lets go(release) a key that is already used by keyDown() method

- How do we create Actions object?
 #1. We create Actions class object
 #2. We pass driver(Driver.getDriver) instance into Actions' constructor
 #3. Now we can use this object for the methods coming from Actions class
 #4. We have to use .perform() method at the end of actions methods

 JAVASCRIPTEXECUTOR:

 - What is JavaScriptExecutor?
  - It is a simple interface coming from Selenium library that allows us to inject(pass)
    JavaScript methods(funtions) into our Java-Selenium code

  - Why do we need it?
   - Because it is very strong web development language
   - Therefore it is useful to be able to pass javascript code into Java-Selenium code for some certain situations

 - How do we use JavaScriptExecutor?
  1. We need to downcast(typecast) our driver type to JavaScriptExecutor
  2. Now we can use the method coming from JavaScriptExecutor
  3. We pass our JavaScript methods into .executeScript() method which will apply it in to our driver session


  Syntax:
             JavascriptExecutor js = ((JavascriptExecutor) Driver.getDriver())

#1.      js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(x,y)")
                                               x --> horizantol line (right/left)
                                               y --> vertical line  (up/down)


#2.     js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true)",element1,element2,element3)

            if you want to reach element1 --> you will use arguments[0]
            if you want to reach element2 --> you will use arguments[1]
            if you want to reach element3 --> you will use arguments[2]

 P.I.Q:

 - How many ways do you know how to scroll?

  There are 4 ways of scroling:

  #1. It is coming from JavascriptExecutor:  js.executeScript("window.scrollBy(x,y)")
  #2. It is coming from JavascriptExecutor:  js.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true)",element1)

  #3. PageUp, PageDown keys using keyboard actions
  #4. We can use moveToElement() method from Actions class
