- FindElement vs FindElements:
 - FindElement:
  -returns single web element
  -return type is WebElement
  -when element is not found, it will throw NoSuchElementException

 - FindElements:
  -returns list of web elements
  -return type is List<WebElement>
  -it will not throw any exception it will return to empty list

- driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlywait(10, TimeUnit.SECOND)

- It is coming from Selenium
- Basicaly this line will allow our driver to wait up to given time , if driver cannot immediatialy locate web element

- We write 1 time and it will appliad to whole driver session
- driver does not have to wait until given time(10sec.) If it is find the web element before maybe in 2sec. it will continue with execution

- checkbox and radio button

P.I.Q: How do you handle checkbox and radio buttons using Selenium?

1. We can click
2. We can check if they are selected or not. --> isSelected()
3. We can check if they are enabled or not. --> isEnebled()

- isSelected() --> if web element is selected, it will return true, if not false
- isEnabled() --> if web element is enabled, it will return true, if not false

- Stale Element Reference Exception

   There are 2 situation that we can get this exception:

 1- navigation (refresh, back, forward)
  -(handle with reassigning(relocating) the web element)
  - relocation means; you will find or reaasign element again
  - cydeoLink = driver.findElement(locator)  ;

 2- when element deleted from both html and page (handle with try/catch)
