XPATH:
- it is one of 8 locator of Selenium
- It allows us to create custom locators using provided any attribute and their values
- We can also use the text of the provided web element to create locator

Xpath has 2 different types:

**P.I.Q: What is difference between absolute and relative xpath

#1. ABSOLUTE XPATH:
 - it starts with single slash "/"
 - it starts looking in html from root/parent to web element
 - it starts from html tag, and it goes down 1 by 1 until we reach to the specific web element that we are loking for
 - This is not good way of locating element
 - it will break wiyh any minimal change in html code

 Syntax: /html/body/div[3]/div/div/tbody/div/button[2]

#2. RELATIVE XPATH:
 - it starts with double slash "//"
 - "//" means you can start from anywhere in HTML code
 - Since we are allowed to start from anywhere in the HTML, relative xpath is very dependable
 - We will use relative xpath, not absolute xpath

MAIN SYNTAX:  //tagName[@atrribute='value']

- How do we go from parent to child using xpath?
 - Using "/" we can go from parent to direct child
 - Uisng "//" we can go from parent to any child(grand-child, grand-grand-child...)


 COMMONLY USED XPATH SYNTAXES:
#1. //tagname[@attribute='value']
#2. //tagname[contains(@attribute,'value')]
#3. //tagname[text()='text of the element'] or //tagname[.='text of element']
                                                 ("." stands for text)
#4. //*[@attribute='value'] --> "*" stands for all tags
                            --> it will make less specific for searching element
