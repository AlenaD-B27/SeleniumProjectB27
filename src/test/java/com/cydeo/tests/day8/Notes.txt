TestBase - BaseTest:

- What is TestBase?
- It is an abstract class where we create and store some re-usable methods/annotations, objects, and also variables if needed.

- Testbase is not a utility class/methods
- TestBase will store some commonly used steps in out tests

- Ideally you want to make TestBase abstract, because an object cannot be created from an abstract class

- Is it mandotory to make TestBase class abstract?No

- When we want to add any logic to Testbase class, we need to make sure it is applicable to all test methods

- If we add a line that is not applicable to all Tests, it might create challenges rather than solving them
